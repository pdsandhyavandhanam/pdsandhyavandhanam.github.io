## Welcome !!. This is a minimalistic page created to learn about Sandhyavandhanam for Pudur Dravid Community. 

### What is Sandhya Vandhanam ?

Sandhyavandanam (Sanskrit: संध्यावन्दनम्, sandhyāvandanam, lit. 'salutation to (Goddess) Sandhyā' or 'salutation during the time of Sandhyā') is a mandatory religious ritual supposed to be daily performed, traditionally, by Dvija communities of Hindus,[1][2] particularly those initiated through the sacred thread ceremony referred to as the Upanayanam and instructed in its execution by a Guru, in this case one qualified to teach Vedic ritual. Sandhyopasana is considered as a path to attain salvation (moksha).

Practice of Sandhyā in Ramayana and Mahabharata by Rama and Krishna can be observed. In Balakanda (23.2, 23.2) of Ramayana, Viswamitra wakes Rama and Lakshmana up at the break of the dawn for the worship of sandhyā. In Udyogaparva (82.21) of Mahabharata there is reference to Krishna performing Sandhya.
