## Welcome !!. This is a minimalistic page created to learn about Sandhyavandhanam for Pudur Dravid Community. 

### What is Sandhya Vandhanam ? 

It is a salutation to the Source inside the Sun God which is driving the three levels of worlds in the universe. Rather than me explaining, I want to take the help of a sanskrit scholor who explained it really well [Here](https://youtu.be/KNavIyIBHTI)
